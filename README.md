Python 2.7

MongoDB - any version

Apache tomcat 7 - running on port 8080

Please include comments at every command explaining what it does.

Write the command to run the Dockerfile such that once the container boots, apache tomcat's home page is accessible from the host on port 7080.



Assignment 2:



Write a bash/python script that takes list of hostnames (comma separated) as an argument.

This script, when executed, should connect to all the servers via. SSH (standard port) (assume password-less connectivity) and give a single prompt to the user.

When the user executes a command on this prompt, the script should run the command on all connected servers and display the output.

Make this as efficient as possible, code comments appreciated.
